In this lab, a back-end server was set up and a chatbot was integrated into a web application. The back-end server was configured, the chatbot was integrated into a Flask server, and communication with the back-end was achieved using a web page. It is assumed that the user knows how to build the simple terminal chatbot explained in the first lab. There are two components required to create a ChatGPT-like website: a back-end server that hosts the chatbot and a front-end web page that communicates with the back-end server.

A back-end server acts as the brains behind a website or application. In this case, the back-end server receives requests from the website, sends them to the chatbot, and returns the response from the chatbot to the website, where it is read by the user.

Flask is a Python framework for building web applications with Python. It provides a set of tools and functionalities to handle incoming requests, process data and generate responses, making website or application development easier.
